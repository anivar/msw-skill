# Use `HttpResponse` for Cookie Mocking Instead of Native `Response`

## Problem

In the browser, the Fetch API forbids the `Set-Cookie` header on a constructed `Response`: `new Response()` with `Set-Cookie` silently drops it. Node.js does not filter the header, so a Node test can pass with a native `Response` while the same handler loses the cookie in the browser.

## Incorrect

```typescript
// BUG (browser): Set-Cookie is a forbidden response header in native Response
http.get('/api/login', () => {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Set-Cookie': 'session=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly',
    },
  })
})
// In the browser, the Set-Cookie header is silently dropped
```

## Correct

```typescript
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw/http'

http.get('/api/login', () => {
  return HttpResponse.json(
    { success: true },
    {
      headers: {
        'Set-Cookie': 'session=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly',
      },
    },
  )
})
```

## When to Use Which

For responses that don't need `Set-Cookie`, you can use either `new Response()` or `HttpResponse`. Both work. Use `HttpResponse` when you need cookies or want consistency.

## Why

In the browser, the Fetch API spec forbids `Set-Cookie` in the `Response` constructor's `Headers`. MSW's `HttpResponse` extends `Response` but keeps the header for mock responses, so mock cookies are testable. Node.js's `Response` does not filter the header (checked on Node 26 with msw 3.0.3), so only `HttpResponse` behaves the same in both environments.
