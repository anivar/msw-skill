# Clone Request Before Reading Body in Lifecycle Events

## Problem

When you read `request.json()` in a lifecycle event listener like `request:start`, the body stream is consumed. MSW can then no longer clone the request for the handler lookup: the lookup fails with `TypeError: unusable`, MSW logs "Encountered an unhandled exception during the handler lookup", and the client receives a 500 response instead of the mock.

## Incorrect

```typescript
// BUG: reading the body consumes the stream — the handler lookup fails and the client gets a 500
server.events.on('request:start', async ({ request }) => {
  const body = await request.json()
  console.log('Request body:', body)
})
```

## Correct

```typescript
server.events.on('request:start', async ({ request }) => {
  const clone = request.clone()
  const body = await clone.json()
  console.log('Request body:', body)
})
```

## Why

The Fetch API `Request` body is a `ReadableStream` — once read, it's consumed. Lifecycle events share the same `Request` object with handlers. Cloning creates an independent copy with its own body stream, so reading in the event listener doesn't interfere with handler resolution.
